defining an function can be either: 
1. async def func()
    which basically means that you're going to use an external library that tells you to call them
    with await
2. def func()
    which can be used in pretty much all other cases. ** Safe to use this when you don't know!

** The value of the path paramter (enclosed in {}) will be passed to your function as the argument

Example of item_id: 
    - the value your function received (and returned) is 3 (for ex) as a Python int, not a string "3"
    - with type declaration, FastAPI gives you automatic request parsing
    - it also gives data validation because it throws errors when types are mismatched and error messages state the exact point where the validation didn't pass

Path operations are evaluated in order so declare "hardcoded" versions before variable paths

If you have a path operation that receives a path parameter, but you want the possible valid path parameter values to be predefined, you can use a standard Python Enum

Adding :path to the path parameter tells that you can append that path to any path

Query Parameters: when you declare other function parameters that are not part of the path parameters, they are automatically interpreted as "query" parameters
    - the query is the set of key-value pairs that go after the ? in a URL, separated by & characters
    - as they are part of the URL they are naturally strings but when you declare them with Python types they are converted to that type and validated against it
    - you can declare optional query parameters by setting their defualt value to None

Request body: data sent by the client to your API
Response body: data your API sends to the client

Pydantic: Python library for data validation and settings management that uses Python type hints to:
    - validate input data
    - convert (coerce) data into the right types
    - provide clear, helpful error messages
    - define data models (like schema)
    - integrate naturally with FastAPI

**item.model_dump()
    - the ** operator unpacks a dictionary into key/value pairs
    - **{"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200} == "name": "Laptop", "price": 1200

If you declare both a return type and a response_model, the response_model will take priority and be used by FastAPI
